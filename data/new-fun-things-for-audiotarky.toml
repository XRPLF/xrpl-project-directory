title = "New Fun Things for Audiotarky"
description = "Audiotarky is a new music streaming platform that prioritises artists and privacy over algorithms and shareholders. Every artist on Audiotarky currently has an ILP enabled wallet, and some familiarity with XRP and/or other digital currency. Through this project, Audiotarky will build the infrastructure to enable the creation of exclusive NFT enabled content to music fans, providing musicians more direct payment for their work, while also giving fans an “investment”. A fan buying an NFT on Audiotarky will provide their ILP, and take a share of streaming revenue (for example if 100 NFTs are minted for a release, an NFT owner would get 1% of the streaming revenue)."
