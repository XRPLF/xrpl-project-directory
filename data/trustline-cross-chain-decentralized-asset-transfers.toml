title = "Trustline - Cross-chain Decentralized Asset Transfers"
description = "Trustline is a new startup developing a way to represent assets on the XRPL without a central counterparty. By leveraging the Flare Network, Trustline's decentralized bridging technology enables the XRPL to store any asset from the Flare Network, including FLR, DOGE, LTC, NFTs, and more -- all without a central counterparty. In the long term, they envision a trustless multi-hop bridge between the XRPL, Flare, and Bitcoin/Ethereum, allowing any major decentralized asset to be represented on the XRPL.\n\nThe Trustline app will enable lower fees and lower interest rates on an open platform, helping payments systems to transition away from proprietary walled gardens. By using the XRPL, Trustline achieves 3-5 second settlement and transaction fees under $0.01."
