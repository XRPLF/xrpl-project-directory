description = "Tax-deductible donations and corporate social responsibility is a multi-trillion dollar industry. This project seeks to leverage NFTs, Hooks, Federated Sidechains and Decentralized Finance (yield farming, liquidity provision) for tax-deductible donations to nonprofits. The first project is the sale of NFTs representing donations to nonprofit organizations with a focus on overdose prevention, youth literacy and reforestation. The user will send a donation to a secure GateHub wallet owned by the nonprofit, and the nonprofit will receive an NFT representing its donation."
