description = "As a bridge between the metaverse and the immersive spatial web, Conjure, built on XREngine, integrates an ecosystem of powerful tools and technologies in a way that is designed to empower users to manipulate reality as they wish. By leveraging IPFS, anyone can host decentralized asset ecosystems embodiable in virtual spaces. By leveraging XRPL, ILP & Coil, anyone can enter a new economic paradigm built on fast, efficient and closed loop peer to peer infrastructure. The intention of Conjure is to provide everyone with immersive collaboration, coordination and communication contexts to construct clearer pictures of the big problems of the world."
