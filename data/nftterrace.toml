description = "Trustline is a new startup developing a way to represent assets on the XRPL without a central counterparty. By leveraging the Flare Network, Trustline's decentralized bridging technology enables the XRPL to store any asset from the Flare Network, including FLR, DOGE, LTC, NFTs, and more -- all without a central counterparty. In the long term, they envision a trustless multi-hop bridge between the XRPL, Flare, and Bitcoin/Ethereum, allowing any major decentralized asset to be represented on the XRPL."
