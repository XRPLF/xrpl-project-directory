description = "Rosetta is looking to explore fiat, XRPL data through visualization. Doing so requires a robust collection framework off of which multiple visualizations can be hung. Rosetta is first taking a look at fiat volumes on exchanges, on the XRPL, and at a later stage will look at ODL patterns and route volume identification."
