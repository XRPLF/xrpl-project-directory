description = "Ultimately, CLUB-LEDGER is an open-source system for tokenizing participation in clubs - organizations of people with a common purpose or interest. First though, CLUB-LEDGER is seeking to revolutionize customer loyalty programs.\n\nCLUB-LEDGER does this by placing the customer, with just one wallet, at the center of their family of retailer programs. The retailer, on the other hand, will enjoy a deeper conversation with their customers because they can reward reviews, surveys, votes, and other interactions with easily transferable tokens."
