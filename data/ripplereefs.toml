description = "The RippleReefs project features a 10,000 piece NFT collection composed of eight unique and interactive sub-collections. Each sub-collection will directly enable the community to support the conservation of our oceans and marine life. By partnering with conservation agencies from around the world, RippleReefs will bring NFTs of their own class to provide a fun, interactive, and educational experience to the XRPL. Its community can look forward to conservation-funding art collections, P2E gaming to incentivize global recycling, metaverse aquariums, and most of all: helping to keep our oceans clean, marine-life in better health, and learning together along the way."
