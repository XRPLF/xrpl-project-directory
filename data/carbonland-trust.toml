description = "Carbonland Trust Protocol and NFTs are carbon-capturing digital assets. Carbonland DAO governance tokens fund forest conservation. Both brands use smart contracts to scale the voluntary carbon markets. Carbonland Trust offers transparency and more co-benefits than most of the current carbon credits on the market. Carbon Credit Buyers will get more impactful credits from Carbonland than currently exist on the market and more liquidity for them. Landowners will have more inclusive access to take part in the voluntary carbon market, and receive equal or better economic opportunities to protect forestland than they would cutting it down."
